# py_exercises
In this  repo I am saving all exercices that I have solved. The saving process is also an exercise for me, because I am learning how to use git and terminal this way. My solves not the best, but the best and shortest variant is not my goal. I can learn some new thing like recursion or datatypes and practice it in this tasks.
